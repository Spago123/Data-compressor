 * @brief Compressor tool for matrices with dimensions NxN (further on boards) that have four possible states for each field
 *        This compressor tool reduces the memory that the board occupies by four
 *        Ex. for a board that has 10x10 = 100 filed(bayts) this tool gives us the abilit to store all that data,
 *        without lossing anything in 25 bayts, as char array (string)
 * @version 0.1
